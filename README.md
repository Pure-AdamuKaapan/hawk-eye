# Hawk-eye

### Problems hawk-eye is addressing
- We waste several precious minutes in each customer escalation call trying to gather the same information about the cluster and nodes.
- Many a times customers are not proficient with pxctl commands and we end up dictating them letter by letter which wastes lot of time and end up asking for control
- While we make progress in our RCA of a customer problem, we wish to have more information about the environment and will have to go back and forth through support channels to get that information.
- While diags are useful tools, it takes an expert to tells us the correct logs to grep for. 
- Even for experts it's a long process to grep through multiple log files across different nodes and try to correlate what could be happeing.
- There is lot of tribal knowledge about best practices. It is told to the customer only when they hit an issue.

Hawk-Eye is a platform that attempts to solve the above problems and more.
